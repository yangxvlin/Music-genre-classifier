This file describes the code for music genre classification project

==============================================================================================
The python codes were wrote using jupyter notebook

Packages:
1: packages from jupyter notebook
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, collections, time, seaborn, sklearn

2: downloadable packages for jupyter notebook:
# imblearn
	installation: download package and import to jupyter notebook
	type: conda install -c glemaitre imbalanced-learn

==============================================================================================
Total of 11 cells are created and fit in one submitted file as .ipynb
The submitted file only contains minimal codes that has been mentioned in the report, those 
unmentioned works are not included.

==============================================================================================
cell 1
import packages and data
==============================================================================================
cell 2, 3
visualize distribution of labels and feature "mode"
==============================================================================================
cell 4
preprocessing
-three functions are built for preprocessing based on hypothesis from the report
the first one is the sampling method
the second and third function is to select either continuous feature or a combination of 
continuous and discrete feature

==============================================================================================
cell 5
train function
-function to train classifiers, and count the training time

==============================================================================================
cell 6
evaluate function
-evaluate with accuracy score, classification report and confusion matrix

==============================================================================================
cell 7
predict function
-predict test labels

==============================================================================================
cell 8 - 11
train, evaluate and predict 4 different models that has been mentioned in the report.
-each cell contains one model with the performance outcomes from three classifiers.
