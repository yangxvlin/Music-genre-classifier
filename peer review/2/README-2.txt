Firstly, I do data preprocing. For audio features, I use StandardScaler function to re-scale the values. For text features, I treat each unique tag as an attribute. Then I assign 1 for the attribute if the text features of the song contain the related tag, otherwise assigning 0. Moreover, I use the Machine learing library sklearn to build zero-R baseline, K-NN model, Gaussian Navie Bayes model, Multi-layer Perceptron model and Decision Tree model. In additon, I implement an eveluation function by using the sklearn library to evaluate the accuracy of the models. For implementing the Multi-layer Perceptron model, I use the GridSearchCV function to find the best parameters for this model. Finally, I implement an output function to output the prediction of test instances as a csv file.
